Sunlight streaming through the holes of my soul<br/>
blinding stagnant morals left behind<br/>
from days of innocence and ignorance.<br/>
Each beam dances on my spirit<br/>
casting shadows on everything I knew as true.<br/>
The old florescent glow evaporating into nothingness;<br/>
what used to touch the corners of my soul is gone<br/>
into a place where light can't be found.<br/>
My darkest secrets are revealed<br/>
through the searing sunbeams<br/>
blaring through my soul<br/>
but still other, perhaps darker secrets,<br/>
melt into the empty shadow,<br/>
scattering my faith.<br/>
Questions arise from these holes, these shadows,<br/>
about who I am, what I believe,<br/>
where I come from, where I'm going.<br/>
Everything I knew as true is a lie<br/>
and slowly the lies are being revealed<br/>
shining brighter than truth, brighter than faith-<br/>
who melt into shadowsâ€¦<br/>
but the sun is setting, taking its lies<br/>
and leaving me<br/>
with nothing<br/>
but holes in my morals<br/>
and shadows on my soul.
