silence lets unspoken words expand<br/>
filling every inch of breath<br/>
with awkward insecurities.<br/>
a dream dies best in silence,<br/>
forgotten amongst hope & expectation,<br/>
buried beneath the avalanche of emotion<br/>
and revealed years later as a corpse,<br/>
an outline of what it longed to be.
