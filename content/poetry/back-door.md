my darling, the night pervades me<br/>
as dreams unlived disrupt my sleep.<br/>
tonight, i ask for more than words:<br/>
just hold me in your arms<br/>
and expect nothing more.<br/>
i have nothing left to give,<br/>
all i can offer you is now&mdash;<br/>
this innocent moment in time,<br/>
so full of words unspoken<br/>
and dreams too good to come true.<br/>
it isn't fair&mdash;it never was&mdash;<br/>
but my need for you outweighs it all.<br/>
i wish i had the strength to care,<br/>
to give what i have left,<br/>
but honestly, there is nothing left.<br/>
every shred of affection gone<br/>
since he walked out the door.<br/>
so tonight, i come baptized in tears,<br/>
through your back door,<br/>
and ask you for everything<br/>
but give nothing in return.<br/>
hold me&mdash;your touch makes me feel real.
