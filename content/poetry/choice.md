standing in the middle of the road of Life,<br/>
trembling, i close my eyes.<br/>
inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.<br/>
opening to see the same menacing road.

which way to go?

a black and angry sign sneers **One Way**.<br/>
it points into oblivion&mdash;<br/>
the unknown.

fear expands,<br/>
filling every pore.<br/>
sweat rolls down my forehead, into my mouth.<br/>
swallowing is impossible.

anxious but curious, i look the other way.

familiar sights smile back.<br/>
my heart flutters as the memories return.<br/>
faces, images, feelings flood my brain.<br/>
the dam that holds my emotions inside breaks<br/>
and i cry out for the past.<br/>
my feet longing to return and cramping in anticipation.

but i can't go back.

the past is behind.<br/>
repetition is more painful than the unknown.<br/>
i gaze again into oblivion.<br/>
a single tear slides from my bloodshot eyes,<br/>
down my dirty cheek and lands on the road.<br/>
slowly, the road swallows that single glistening tear.

my feet begin to move,<br/>
disconnected from my brain.<br/>
darkness surrounds&mdash;<br/>
the unknown&mdash;<br/>
but i can never look back.
