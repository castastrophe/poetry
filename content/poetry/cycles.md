everyone says it's a game or a dance&mdash;<br/>
i think its inevitable,<br/>
a cycle&mdash;<br/>
like weather or the food chain.<br/>
there's a system, an order<br/>
from which you can never deviate.<br/>
you start free-falling,<br/>
flipping head over heals,<br/>
stomach churning,<br/>
fear collecting in your throat,<br/>
panic slowly setting in.<br/>
then your mind begins to process,<br/>
begins to plan, begins to fix,<br/>
trying to strategize<br/>
or find an answer to the equation<br/>
(there isn't one).<br/>
and finally, finally you give up,<br/>
you give in, you relax,<br/>
you let go, you accept.<br/>
and once you've done all this,<br/>
once you followed the steps<br/>
(maybe skipping some here and there<br/>
or taking them in a different order),<br/>
they leave you<br/>
standing alone<br/>
in the desert with a heavy cloud above you<br/>
about to release.<br/>
they leave you and you have to start over.<br/>
you have to start free-falling again,<br/>
you have to start strategizing again,<br/>
you have to start giving in again<br/>
because there's nothing else to do.<br/>
once the rain comes down<br/>
it has to evaporate;<br/>
once the sun gives life<br/>
it must be eaten;<br/>
once you fall in love...
