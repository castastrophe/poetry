i spent this semester wandering in a fog<br/>
with only one desire&mdash;escape.<br/>
then you&mdash;<br/>
warmth and joy, comfort and ease,<br/>
the most perfect evening.<br/>
words flowed like honey,<br/>
gentle and sweet,<br/>
moving slowly but with substance,<br/>
with meaning.<br/>
and there was you&mdash;<br/>
that smile (i can't feel my legs),<br/>
breath caught in my throat.<br/>
please don't end.<br/>
don't let this night be over.<br/>
i never want to leave.<br/>
tonight the clocks are my enemy<br/>
taking up arms against me<br/>
as the seconds fly by.<br/>
and tonight, so is my fear.<br/>
i wish i could ask you to stay.<br/>
to hold me as i sleep,<br/>
quiet and warm, innocent and secure.<br/>
but the words don't come out<br/>
because i don't know what to say<br/>
and i don't know what you'd say<br/>
and as we walk to the door,<br/>
my regrets begin to knock.<br/>
i can't believe i let this happen<br/>
i wish i could stay just for you<br/>
because g&mdash;d only knows when,<br/>
if, i'll ever meet someone like you again.<br/>
and as those fears crossed my eyes<br/>
you moved close

and kissed me.
