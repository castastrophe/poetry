choose one word to describe yourself:<br/>
Infinite.

i hate those quizzes,<br/>
the ones that ask you to describe yourself in Fragments.<br/>
Fragments are fitting&mdash;<br/>
but that's not the Point.<br/>
i *am* the Fragments.<br/>
i *am* the single thought<br/>
meshed and melded with the rest<br/>
in a conglomeration of emotion&mdash;<br/>
but that's not the Point.

the Point<br/>
is that one word will never describe me.<br/>
one word will never engulf me.<br/>
one word will never fulfill me.<br/>
a Picture is worth a thousand words&mdash;<br/>
i am a Picture.<br/>
a Picture of confusion,<br/>
of perfection,<br/>
of eternity,<br/>
of divinity,<br/>
and if nothing else,<br/>
a Picture of myself.

do you understand?<br/>
there is no one word,<br/>
no single entity,<br/>
that is Myself,<br/>
that is what i view in the mirror,<br/>
because what i view is only a Perception&mdash;<br/>
only an idea of Me,<br/>
a concept of the I.

what i see is not what you see.<br/>
what you see is never the same.<br/>
today i am Entirety,<br/>
tomorrow i am Invisible,<br/>
and yesterday,<br/>
yesterday i was Nonexistent.

and you?<br/>
today you are Everything,<br/>
tomorrow you are Anything,<br/>
and yesterday,<br/>
yesterday you were Nothing.

i hate yesterday.<br/>
i hate tomorrow.<br/>
all i have is today.<br/>
all i have is the single word,<br/>
the single Perception,<br/>
the single idea that is Today.<br/>
how you see me,<br/>
how i see you,<br/>
and how we see ourselves&mdash;<br/>
Today is all that counts,<br/>
is that matters,<br/>
is all i see,<br/>
is all i understand,<br/>
is all i want...

until Tomorrow comes.
