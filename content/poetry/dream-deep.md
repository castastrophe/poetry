in her dreams there is a boat<br/>
and water bluer than a clear day sky.<br/>
gently the waves lap up<br/>
beating on the sides of the boat like a tambourine,<br/>
a slow and steady rhythm to set her heart to.

the wind blows fresh.<br/>
salt and freedom flying through her hair<br/>
whispering promises of tomorrow,<br/>
promises she cannot resist<br/>
and faithfully, hopefully, the boat proceeds.

on the horizon, dark clouds,<br/>
lightning, thunder, flashes and screams.<br/>
like a wall her sunny day cuts off ahead,<br/>
the line between peace and terror clearly traced<br/>
but she sees the beauty in both and forward goes.

in the rain, the tears, the hurt,<br/>
she is at peace somehow,<br/>
understanding the cycle, the purpose.<br/>
the boat pushes onward, battered and torn<br/>
hoping it is built to withstand this unseen event.

on the other side, rays of light<br/>
painful to the eyes at first, thick and intense,<br/>
but when they adjust, a sight more beautiful than before.<br/>
in this new light, they seem different, the boat and her,<br/>
somehow the storm has changed them.

letting down the anchor, they stop,<br/>
soaking in light, warmth, the finality of peace.<br/>
there is a confidence present that wasn't there before<br/>
and love seeps in, filling every inch of them<br/>
finally fulfilling the promises they left port to seek.

there is a faith in it,<br/>
a belief that in port seemed so naive, so ignorant,<br/>
and yet unlike the others who turned away,<br/>
here they sit in paradise, more beauty than they thought possible,<br/>
at peace with themselves, at peace with the world.

that kind of joy, that kind of happy ending,<br/>
it takes a fight, it takes a chance.<br/>
perhaps they were lost at sea, only in death seeing this paradise they dreamed of,<br/>
or maybe they were right, maybe there is beauty in the pain,<br/>
maybe in the end, it is worth the struggle.

only the oceans know.
