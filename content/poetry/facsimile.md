count breaths<br/>
2…3…<br/>
watch their eyes<br/>
their lips<br/>
what they have to say<br/>
beyond words

a colored shirt and sweater vest<br/>
hair fresh from the golf course<br/>
beside him<br/>
off-white pearls and golden curls<br/>
every strand in perfect place<br/>
between them<br/>
a coldness<br/>
the stench of betrayal hovers

she laughs a hearty cry<br/>
manners hang like a mask<br/>
protecting something sacred

he leans into her<br/>
whispers in tones<br/>
although you can't hear<br/>
you can see what he says<br/>
her smile fades inward<br/>
a confidence shattered<br/>
he moves back and doesn't see<br/>
the brokenness in her eyes

the evening ends and crowd departs
