i am aquarius.<br/>
i like to lick empty envelopes and mail them to timbuktu (where-ever that is)<br/>
because i imagine their world to be very different from my own<br/>
(maybe sunny and scattered with patches of sand).<br/>
i imagine the letter reaching that somewhere bent and ragged.<br/>
it's being torn open by warm, sticky fingers<br/>
(maybe she was in the middle of making a jam sandwich<br/>
or maybe his air conditioning has been broken for months).<br/>
the recipient (who-ever they are) looks puzzled and confused,<br/>
peering over and shaking the empty envelope vehemently.<br/>

i like to sit online and google places i'll never see;<br/>
places with crazy names like zimbabwe or milwalkie.<br/>
i like to zoom in on the map and pick out the next stop<br/>
on my whirlwind adventure across the globe<br/>
(you know, that trip i'll never be able to afford<br/>
because i'm still barely able to pay rent-<br/>
let alone save for a whirlwind adventure across the globe).<br/>

i think i have maybe twenty dollars in my bank account<br/>
and about a million places i want to go<br/>
(i'm exaggerating, there's only actually fifty as of now).<br/>
in spite of all that (or perhaps to spite all that)<br/>
i still add a tack to the crusty, old map<br/>
whenever i scroll past the name of another far-off place<br/>
with sandy beaches and several cities of not-here-ness.<br/>

its not that i dislike my life.<br/>
there's nothing wrong with the squeaky door and noisy neighbors<br/>
(who probably have an elephant living with them upstairs).<br/>
i have plenty of food, friends, (and beer-<br/>
to wash away the memories of yesterdays sins).<br/>
there's not really a lot else that i need<br/>
(except maybe the dream of something bigger).<br/>

i am aquarius-<br/>
liquid, see-through, always moving<br/>
(dreaming those damn impossible dreams<br/>
in a dusty, creaky, moldy one bedroom in nowhere, usa).
