the world has worn me ragged<br/>
and i am tired.  i am exhausted.<br/>
people tearing and ripping, gnawing and biting,<br/>
breaking my heart into pieces,<br/>
shreds of hope and confidence littering the floor

and &emsp; i &emsp; am &emsp; tired.

the sky is dark and cries with me&mdash;<br/>
heavy, fiery drops from heaven raining down and melting my skin<br/>
and we all blend together again.<br/>
so much emphasis on being separate<br/>
only to die together and alone.<br/>
the realizations grasp my chest and start to consume what's left,<br/>
so &emsp; i &emsp; run.

i run fast and hard and long<br/>
until the sun stops coming up<br/>
and the cold starts creeping in.<br/>
it starts with my skin and seeps to the core,<br/>
making my body quake until bones begin to shatter.<br/>
then finally<br/>
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; my heart stops.

and i stop feeling it anymore&mdash;<br/>
i &emsp; stop &emsp; feeling &emsp; anything.<br/>
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; no more *i love you*s or *i miss you*s,<br/>
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; no more *i'm sorry*s or *forgive you*s,<br/>
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; all i'm left with is exhaustion and a hint of fear. 
                 
i am afraid(ofyou)<br/>
of letting myself be warm again,<br/>
of letting the searing rain fall on my face,<br/>
and letting myself melt and mesh with you again.<br/>
lies and hatred and ripping and tearing<br/>
but i keep coming back to the door,<br/>
standing, waiting for you to come home,<br/>
praying you don't (butknowingyouwill).

i want the rain to be cold and wet,<br/>
to fill the cracks in my dry aching skin<br/>
and make me beautiful again&mdash;<br/>
make &emsp; me &emsp; whole.<br/>
i want hope and love and beauty<br/>
and i want you to be who i thought you were<br/>
(notwhoyouendedupbeing)<br/>
because &emsp; i &emsp; loved &emsp; you &emsp; backthen.

as tired as i am,<br/>
i keep believing and keep coming back and keep opening the door<br/>
because i &emsp; hoped &emsp; someone else would walk through.<br/>

it's &emsp; always &emsp; you.<br/>

after all the hurt, the tears, the ripping, the tearing,<br/>
i am still too tired to hate you, too tired to be angry.<br/>
after everything, we are still standing at the same door<br/>
with the same question.<br/>
 &emsp; i &emsp; don't &emsp; have &emsp; the &emsp; answer.<br/>
but as i stand here, staring into your orange eyes,<br/>
i'm not sad. i'm not your victim.<br/>
somewhere along the way i stopped expecting you to change.<br/>
you and i are broken and together we fall to pieces.

perhaps<br/>
we &emsp; are &emsp; all &emsp;  &emsp; b &emsp; r &emsp; o &emsp; k &emsp; e &emsp; n &emsp; .<br/>
broken and running and frozen and alone.
