i seem to remember his lips<br/>
a ghostly touch, too idyllic<br/>
and red&mdash;like the color of my cheeks<br/>
as his hand enveloped my face

i seem to remember his voice<br/>
the echoes of a feeling no longer felt<br/>
something thick and sweet<br/>
like honey sliding down the throat

i seem to remember a promise<br/>
a love he said would last forever<br/>
a love he said would change our lives<br/>
but like money, it was gone in an instant

i seem to remember reading somewhere<br/>
that forever was a long time&mdash;<br/>
longer than even heaven could count&mdash;<br/>
but then, i suppose he never read that
