sitting at my desk, cold and metal,<br/>
the recycled memories of long-dead trees<br/>
sleeping blankly before me,<br/>
my mind wanders.

all my life i've been waiting here,<br/>
silent, still, and blind to everything around.<br/>
to my left, an open window.<br/>
i feel the unusually warm breeze seeping in,<br/>
i smell the paper plant down the river,<br/>
but my eyes are blank,<br/>
the world beyond my desk is dark and empty.

tonight, the lights went out&mdash;<br/>
all of them, everywhere&mdash;for good.<br/>
the world was working dilligently,<br/>
typing and reading and writing,<br/>
each of them using and consuming.

the darkness was slow, gradual, subtle.<br/>
at first no one even noticed,<br/>
just kept working, typing, droning.<br/>
it wasn't until the final bulb went out<br/>
and suddenly everyone was blind.

except me.

i could see for the first time&mdash;<br/>
mountains and fields and hillsides,<br/>
and beside the running rivers<br/>
whole cities of rusting metal and broken concrete.

i could see them all, everyone.<br/>
their candles lit all across the world&mdash;<br/>
a soft, orange glow embracing everything<br/>
and i saw the world begin to burn.

it spread like wildfire&mdash;spontaneous and intense.<br/>
i saw it consume the flesh, the bodies, the buildings.<br/>
i watched the world die<br/>
and in its place, something new begin.

there was life, for the first time, life.<br/>
i saw love and hope and harmony&mdash;<br/>
feelings and emotions i'd forgot ever existed.<br/>
i had been blind, perhaps we had all been blind.

then the lights went out, and finally,<br/>
finally we could see.
