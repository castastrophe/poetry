the Sun is low on the horizon,<br/>
large and deep orange,<br/>
heavy like a balloon full of water<br/>
about to burst.<br/>
the Sky is blue and pink and purple<br/>
smeared like icing by sticky little hands.<br/>
outside, trees rush by -<br/>
little houses and big green trees.<br/>

the engine bumps and rattles<br/>
making the whole car shake<br/>
and my seat vibrates in place.<br/>
its an old car - no seat belts -<br/>
red leather benches faded from wear.<br/>

you breathe steadily beside me,<br/>
calm and focused on the road.<br/>
my little hands hold the ends of the bench<br/>
to keep from rocking.<br/>
you look over and smile.<br/>

home.
