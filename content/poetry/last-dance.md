The rolling curves of her emerald dress<br/>
glimmer in the strobe lights<br/>
which dance a figure-eight across the floor.

Hips swaying to the steady rhythm,<br/>
her gown becomes a bell,<br/>
quietly beckoning churchgoers.

Couples litter the dance floor,<br/>
clinging desperately to each other for support,<br/>
bodies pulled close,<br/>
hearts intertwined,<br/>
feet moving mindlessly across the clouds.

Her carefully painted eyelids shut&mdash;<br/>
not to keep the dancers out,<br/>
but rather&mdash;to bring him in.

The singer begins a haunting melody,<br/>
a slow seduction for innocent minds,<br/>
the perfect memory trapped within it's notes<br/>
revealed at last to those still young in heart&mdash;<br/>
the last dance.

Her arms reach out to him,<br/>
wrapping themselves around his neck,<br/>
the tips of her fingers barely touching his soft, brown locks.

Following suit, reading her mind, knowing her motives,<br/>
he reaches back, his sturdy hands enveloping the satin at her hips,<br/>
soft and warm to his gentle touch.

Words are lost in the moment,<br/>
the music absorbing every feeling, every thought,<br/>
saying everything their mouths cannot.

In her mind, they dance cheek to cheek,<br/>
closer than any couple in the room.

She collects every note, every detail&mdash;<br/>
the feel of the cool tile against her bare feet,<br/>
the hovering smell of perfume, cologne, and sweat,<br/>
the sound of hearts meeting for the first time,<br/>
the taste of wanting something too far away to have&mdash;<br/>
she pulls them all close and hides them away,<br/>
the last dance.

She gathers every memory,<br/>
locking them away until she can feel his soft caress<br/>
and brush her hand across his rosy cheek,<br/>
until their lips finally touch&mdash;<br/>
anxious but certain, passionate but refined.

She saves it all so that<br/>
together, hand in hand,<br/>
they can relive it,<br/>
cheek to cheek,<br/>
closer than anyone in the room.

She dances the last dance alone,<br/>
but in her mind, she's dancing with him.

Always with him.
