leaving, no matter how welcome it may seem,<br/>
is hardest tonight.<br/>
i think it's the potential,<br/>
what could be, what only just began.<br/>
with time, what if?<br/>
but what ifs are dangerous beings<br/>
ghostly and almost unreal<br/>
but deadly when asked at the wrong time.<br/>
so we kiss goodnight,<br/>
we kiss and all the words sit in-between.<br/>
i broke my promise.<br/>
i said i wouldn't get involved.<br/>
said i wouldn't get attached.<br/>
but it was you, and all it took was a smile.
