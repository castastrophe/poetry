chalk marks the spot&mdash;<br/>
a shooting at the Waffle House.

pancakes & laughter<br/>
friendship smeared with butter<br/>
topped with strawberries & maple syrup<br/>
soaking up the alcohol of raucous nights<br/>
that seep into early mornings.

Maybe we're all<br/>
dead inside &emsp; ( and full of grease ),<br/>
reduced to a chalk drawing on the pavement.<br/>

oh god. &emsp;&emsp;a shooting<br/>
at the Waffle House?
