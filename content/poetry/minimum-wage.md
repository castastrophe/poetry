time has no meaning<br/>
when i walk in that back door<br/>
and put a nametag on my turquoise polo,

my ball and chain.

suddenly, time disappears,<br/>
a figment of this dreamer's mind<br/>
tick-tocking away like mad just beyond the revolving door.

watch it dance and play<br/>
as we stand, straight-faced,<br/>
waiting, praying, begging for the day to end.

it's a conspiracy.

inside that building,<br/>
we watch as the hands slow<br/>
and finally, once we pass the first hour, it stops

and laughs.

i think management<br/>
does it on purpose to steal from us<br/>
those few extra hours without pay.

it's stupid, but<br/>
it's just the kind of joke<br/>
they'd play on us poor minimum-wage zombies.

shove it, corporate bastards.

i don't need your 5.95.<br/>
i don't need your 8-hour shifts.<br/>
(well i do, but maybe living at home won't be so bad).

i quit.
