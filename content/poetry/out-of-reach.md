a dense red fog surrounds my mind<br/>
pervading every thought that threatens to emerge.<br/>
my heart sits tied in knots&mdash;<br/>
twisting and pulling&mdash;<br/>
desperate for a day when the pain will subside,<br/>
leaving it alone long enough to heal<br/>
the seeping holes that remain.<br/>
every word that drips from my open mouth<br/>
wreaks havoc on the ones i love<br/>
simply because my mind is otherwise employed.

i'm confused,<br/>
so lost that even love hurts.

your eyes hit like meteors,<br/>
burning through my weak flesh,<br/>
making me a puddle on the floor.

i can't breathe.<br/>
the smell of you<br/>
wraps it's musky hands around my neck,<br/>
squeezing with a tender strength,<br/>
laughing as i fall lifeless to the floor.

if i could think for just a minute,<br/>
maybe i could gather the fragments of my heart<br/>
and lift the veil that holds my senses captive.<br/>
the lingering realization<br/>
that i can't have you<br/>
hovers before me&mdash;<br/>
a ghost that dissipates as i reach out,<br/>
grasping at mist.
