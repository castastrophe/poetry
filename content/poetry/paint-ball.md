blue that reaches.<br/>
blue that seeks the very end.<br/>
pink that fades into the water blue.<br/>
yellow lingers on<br/>
and dances in the crystal world<br/>
as white tops crash into cold stones of gray.

green that waves.<br/>
green that meets the water near.<br/>
red that blooms and spots the ground of green.<br/>
yellow lingers on<br/>
and shines upon the fields of light below,<br/>
and the world of color splashes into cold stones of gray.
