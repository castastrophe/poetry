i am standing in a River flowing sdrawkcab.<br/>
wetness creeps up my pantlegs<br/>
as Water spits and splashes around me.<br/>
my eyes are shut,<br/>
but my mind reaches out<br/>
and sees all.<br/>

to my right, you sit<br/>
legs dangling from the bank,<br/>
dipping quietly into the water<br/>
(my water).<br/>
behind you the sun is warm and comforting.<br/>
the Trees reach straight to the sky<br/>
like a stairway to the gates of Heaven.<br/>
your eyes are closed<br/>
and on your lips, a Song-<br/>
a delicate whistle<br/>
that tickles the tips of my ears.<br/>

to my left, she stands,<br/>
arms crossed, fueling angry Winds<br/>
that whip and whirl her clothes about.<br/>
her eyes are hollow and black,<br/>
(i can almost see my reflection).<br/>
she is determined to have her way<br/>
and her dark eyes are locked on you.<br/>

Waves lash and spin<br/>
rippling from her,<br/>
as though born of her anger.<br/>
they turn my quiet Brook into a raging River<br/>
and my body is swept away<br/>
leaving my soul shivering and alone.<br/>

i want to cry,<br/>
but i have no eyes.<br/>
i want to scream,<br/>
but i have no mouth.<br/>
i want to fight,<br/>
but my arms and legs have been carried away.<br/>
i am cold,<br/>
a deeper cold than i've ever felt,<br/>
a dark, angry cold<br/>
creeping from her side of the river.<br/>

i start to lose faith<br/>
(in you, in us)<br/>
and as i do<br/>
my spirit s l o w l y begins to fade.<br/>

then,<br/>
(when i am almost gone)<br/>
i feel a warmth,<br/>
i see a hand,<br/>
and my soul comes flooding back<br/>
and my body is built anew.<br/>

you take my hand<br/>
and pull me to your shore.<br/>
you hold me, kiss me,<br/>
tight,<br/>
and the storm is swept away.<br/>

the Sun is bright,<br/>
the Birds are singing,<br/>
and finally i am safe<br/>
and assured.<br/>

on the opposite bank,<br/>
the storm has calmed<br/>
and we watch as she begins to cry.<br/>
reach out, i ask.<br/>
we do, heart and hands<br/>
and pull her into the light.<br/>
love and beauty,<br/>
you and i,<br/>
and she can go on living,<br/>
and i can too,<br/>
with you<br/>
f o r e v e r.
