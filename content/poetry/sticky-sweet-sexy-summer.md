i like to walk barefoot on burning asphalt.<br/>
naked feet hopping over ragged stones,<br/>
searing sunshine pouring through every gap,<br/>
hot, sweating skin & the smiling sun upon my back<br/>
kissing my rosy cheeks as i pant with exhaustion.

i like to lie on my back in fields of grass & dandelions;<br/>
their delicate petals tickle my bare arms,<br/>
laughing and dancing as the wind wanders by,<br/>
my senses enraptured, pollen seeping from every pore,<br/>
the sweet scented flowers clogging my nose with desire.

i like to stand alone with arms upturned,<br/>
face to the sky, embracing the rain.<br/>
watch as my clothes melt away,<br/>
clinging until i am only skin.<br/>
i taste the bitter flavor of tomorrow in a single drop;<br/>
feel it cascade down my face,<br/>
mascara lines engulfing my cheeks as though i cried for hours<br/>
cried to be cold, to be naked & new.<br/>
cried to be washed away, dripping down sewer drains<br/>
following the crashing flow to the ocean's shore.

the sweet seductions of summer flow like honey,<br/>
landing warm in my empty stomach, satisfying & saturating.<br/>
intoxicating love, drunken desire, full & pregnant belly of life<br/>
kiss me hard on the mouth & suck out every doubt of tomorrow,<br/>
every memory of concrete oceans & steel structures that blot out the sun.<br/>
help me forget the broken promises of yesterday<br/>
& give birth to the innocence of new life & new hope.<br/>
kiss me sweet summer, seduce me until i forget,<br/>
then wash the old shell away in a never-ending rain.<br/>
scrub me until i am clean & raw, exposed for who & what i really am&mdash;<br/>
a dreamer & a lover.
