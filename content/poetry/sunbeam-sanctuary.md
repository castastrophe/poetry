i hear the footsteps of my unborn children<br/>
pit-pat on the cold, linoleum kitchen floor

soft and pink and covered in mud<br/>
dark red clay mixed with tears from heaven<br/>
caked into the crevices of tiny toes

avid adventurers, eyes alight and stories streaming<br/>
as i dip their little feet in warm water

bars of soap and several scrub-brushes later<br/>
and only the dark red lining beneath their toenails<br/>
remain to tell the tale

fluffy, white towels and arms encircle their drooping heads<br/>
as the sun dips fast beneath the red mountains

pinks, blues, and purples smeared like finger paint across the horizon<br/>
their memories melting into dreams<br/>
as the moon replaces the sun on the throne in the sky

i fluff their pillows and kiss their foreheads<br/>
smiling gently as they fight to stay awake

eyelids dropping slowly, almost regretfully<br/>
as i sing the celtic lullaby my mother sang to me<br/>
on cool dry nights so heavy even the wind couldn't blow

as the final sliver of light disappears from the heavens<br/>
the imagery melts away, preserved in hope for another day
