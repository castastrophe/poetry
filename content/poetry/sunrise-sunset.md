sunlight streaming through the holes of my soul,<br/>
blinding stagnant morals left behind<br/>
from days of innocence and ignorance.<br/>
each beam dances on my spirit,<br/>
casting shadows on everything i knew as true.<br/>
the old florescent glow evaporating into nothingness;<br/>
what used to touch the corners of my soul is gone<br/>
into a place where light can't be found.<br/>
my darkest secrets are revealed<br/>
through the searing sunbeams<br/>
blaring through my soul,<br/>
but still other, perhaps darker secrets,<br/>
melt into the empty shadow,<br/>
scattering my faith.<br/>
questions arise from these holes, these shadows,<br/>
about who i am, what i believe,<br/>
where i come from, where i'm going.<br/>
everything i knew as true is a lie<br/>
and slowly the lies are being revealed,<br/>
shining brighter than truth, brighter than faith&mdash;<br/>
who melt into shadows.<br/>
the sun is setting, taking it's lies<br/>
and leaving me<br/>
with nothing<br/>
but holes in my morals<br/>
and shadows on my soul.
