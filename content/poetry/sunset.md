i gaze out the dirty, third floor window<br/>
of my high-rise apartment,<br/>
watching in silence as the sweating sun<br/>
kisses the midnight sky,<br/>
turning it crimson with passion and lust<br/>
until every inch burns with the heat of desire.<br/>

the supple sun begins to dim,<br/>
her vigor and energy fading with exertion.<br/>
she reaches her slender rays toward the north star,<br/>
clinging to the hope of tomorrow,<br/>
praying for the sunset of a new day.<br/>

and then, in one exhilarating flash,<br/>
one moment of perfect joy,<br/>
and she is gone,<br/>
resting until the birth of a new day.
