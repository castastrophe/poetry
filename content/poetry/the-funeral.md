hot wind<br/>
breathing heavy on my face<br/>
as it runs through my hair;<br/>
desperate to escape.<br/>

red sun<br/>
burning with forgotten feelings,<br/>
melting down toward the trees,<br/>
its color bleeding through the sky.<br/>

i am sitting on a hilltop<br/>
beside a lake<br/>
wearing the same dress i wore on our anniversary.

white lace and cotton<br/>
and just above my knee you can see it-<br/>
the stain where i spilled my drink<br/>
as you asked me to marry you.<br/>

my fingers reach to touch it<br/>
but never make it,<br/>
hovering over the dress<br/>
as if held by invisible strings.<br/>

i close my chocolate eyes<br/>
and taste the words we never said<br/>
as they dance slowly past my lips.<br/>

my mouth begins to water,<br/>
so i bite, savoring their flavor-<br/>
bittersweet, like dreams forgotten.<br/>

i touch my hand<br/>
and as the wind whispers its desperate pleas<br/>
i slip the ring off my ringer<br/>
and raise my arm in salute to the hot, red sun.<br/>

a scream escapes<br/>
and i watch, helpless,<br/>
as the ring is flung into the silvery waters<br/>
swallowed immediately by reflections of the sun.<br/>

finally,<br/>
the weight of a thousand summers is gone<br/>
and i can breathe smooth, sultry breaths again.<br/>

i stand, turning my back on the lake,<br/>
leaving you to sleep at the bottom,<br/>
a memory of what i cannot have,<br/>
and i never come back.<br/>
