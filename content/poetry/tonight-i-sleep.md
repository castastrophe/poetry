tonight i sleep long and deep.<br/>
tonight i dream.<br/>
in my dream i am walking down a road paved with Hope<br/>
in shoes of Idealism and Naivety.<br/>
the road is long and dark<br/>
but my feet keep walking<br/>
as though compelled by something stronger.<br/>
at the end of the road, a wall, and in front of it, you.<br/>
you are dressed in robes of gleaming Expectations<br/>
holding a bouquet of Insecurity and Doubt.<br/>
you open your mouth to speak,<br/>
and in that moment i have to kiss you.<br/>
in that moment i am consumed by love.<br/>
i take your head in my hands<br/>
and we are lost - the world fades to black.<br/>
Romances begin to shed<br/>
and our worries about Yesterdays,<br/>
our fears about Tomorrows â€“ are gone.<br/>
my love, i expect no Tomorrows -<br/>
but that kiss shall hold me captive long after its done.<br/>
so instead, kiss me harder.<br/>
never let the dreaming end.
