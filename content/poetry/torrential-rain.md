yellow light breaks over everything,<br/>
it's warmth singeing the skin.<br/>
people racing to escape,<br/>
taking shelter in the shadows,<br/>
huddled together like cattle.<br/>
i sit alone in the light<br/>
and cannot feel the heat at all<br/>
because it's raining torrents in my heart<br/>
you can see it just behind the eyes.<br/>
like a shield it protects me from the sun<br/>
whose wicked beams seek out my flesh.<br/>
and so i thank you<br/>
thank you for bringing the clouds,<br/>
for drowning my soul in your sorrows,<br/>
because today, the light is begging to get in<br/>
and though it will eventually consume the rest,<br/>
the rain you left me<br/>
will last a lifetime.
