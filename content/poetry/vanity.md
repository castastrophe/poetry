sitting at the dresser<br/>
eyes trapped in the mirror<br/>
staring. wanting...more.<br/>
but nothing changes.

lost in the reflection,<br/>
vision blurs<br/>
and at once, the image is clear:<br/>
a million pieces.

every fragment<br/>
the remnant of umet expectations,<br/>
a graveyard for long forgotten dreams;<br/>
a work of picasso.

the image surpasses distortion<br/>
as priorities skew beyond recognition,<br/>
leaving behind the person once valued above all<br/>
only pieces of the self.
