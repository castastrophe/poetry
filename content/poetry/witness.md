I feel the rhythm of the train<br/>
rumbling through my veins,<br/>
tempo taking over<br/>
until my heart beats in time.

Each of us sit silent at our windows<br/>
as the morning light streams<br/>
through the dirt-streaked panes;<br/>
witnesses to the changing world<br/>
but separated by steel and glass.

Push and rattle through the towering high-rises<br/>
of growing cities, unable to see the top<br/>
through our narrow viewports;<br/>
past rows of identical houses and<br/>
into vast open fields of wheat and cotton;<br/>
empty mills and abandoned factories<br/>
whose broken windows and crumbling bricks<br/>
sigh with hopelessness.

Witness the scattered trash and debris<br/>
beneath concrete bridges;<br/>
see the earth rising up,<br/>
conquerer of fear and despair,<br/>
vines and grasses reclaiming vacant buildings,<br/>
budding young trees discarding shingles<br/>
as they yearn for the sun.

Together we witness, weary travelers,<br/>
melding our perceptions and ideas of the world<br/>
with the realities we see beyond the glass;<br/>
letting the gray and green seep into<br/>
our own reflections<br/>
as the sun reveals the echoes of our faces<br/>
imposed upon the landscape.
